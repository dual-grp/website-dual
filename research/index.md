# {% include icon.html icon="fa-solid fa-microscope" %}Research

Our research explores the intersection of distributed computing, mathematical optimization, and artificial intelligence to build scalable, efficient, and reliable edge learning systems. We design algorithms that integrate distributed architectures with optimization principles to improve the efficiency, fairness, and interpretability of modern AI-edgeâ€”focusing on large language models, federated and edge learning, and real-time collaborative inference. By linking theoretical foundations with practical deployment, the team develops new insights and deployable frameworks that enable intelligent systems to operate reliably in heterogeneous, resource-constrained environments.
